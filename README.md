# Projects

## Concurrent File Transfer Protocol (CFTP) --- [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Ahmed-Shahriar/CFTP)

- Jan 2024 – Feb 2024
- Created a layer-5 file transfer protocol using Go, supporting concurrent uploads/downloads over TCP/IP and UDP.
- Modularized core operations atop Go's `net.Conn` interface for seamless, protocol-agnostic transport integrations.
- Leveraged goroutines for parallel client--server nodes, sustaining multi-file transfers with minimal overhead.
- Benchmarked performance under 4 concurrent clients x 10 transfers each to evaluate throughput and reliability.

## WLP4 Compiler --- [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Ahmed-Shahriar/WLP4Compiler)

- Feb 2023 – Apr 2023
- Built a full WLP4 compiler in C++, implementing custom NFA, CFG, and AST modules from first principles.
- Generated MIPS assembly through an end-to-end toolchain (lexer → parser → generator → linker → assembler).
- Devised optimization engine reducing assembly output by 38%, from 144K down to 89K on benchmark suite.

## Predictive Text Suggestions --- [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Ahmed-Shahriar/PredictiveTextSuggestions)

- Apr 2023 – Apr 2023
- Developed a C++ predictive text engine using compressed tries to suggest word auto-completions to users.
- Incorporated frequency weighting to prioritize commonly typed words, enhancing user experience over time.
- Achieved constant time predictions per keystroke, averaging under 50ms for real-time auto-completion.

## CFA Tools --- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AhmedShahriar.cfa-tools) | [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Ahmed-Shahriar/cfa-tools)

- Sep 2025 – Present
- Maintain my published VS Code extension providing the **only** available [C∀](https://cforall.uwaterloo.ca/) programming language tooling.
- Develop a real-time syntax engine to improve code readability and enable future AI + IntelliSense integration.
- Use this tool daily in CS 343 (Parallel Programming) to build concurrent programs with highlighted C∀ primitives.
