    projects:
      - name: Concurrent File Transfer Protocol (CFTP) --- [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Ahmed-Shahriar/CFTP)
        start_date: 2024-01
        end_date: 2024-02
        highlights:
          - Created a layer-5 file transfer protocol using Go, supporting concurrent uploads/downloads over TCP/IP and UDP.
          - Modularized core operations atop Go's `net.Conn` interface for seamless, protocol-agnostic transport integrations.
          - Leveraged goroutines for parallel client--server nodes, sustaining multi-file transfers with minimal overhead.
          - Benchmarked performance under 4 concurrent clients x 10 transfers each to evaluate throughput and reliability.

      - name: WLP4 Compiler --- [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Ahmed-Shahriar/WLP4Compiler)
        start_date: 2023-02
        end_date: 2023-04
        highlights:
          - Built a full WLP4 compiler in C++, implementing custom NFA, CFG, and AST modules from first principles.
          - Generated MIPS assembly through an end-to-end toolchain (lexer → parser → generator → linker → assembler).
          - Devised optimization engine reducing assembly output by 38%, from 144K down to 89K on benchmark suite.

      - name: Predictive Text Suggestions --- [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Ahmed-Shahriar/PredictiveTextSuggestions)
        start_date: 2023-04
        end_date: 2023-04
        highlights:
          - Developed a C++ predictive text engine using compressed tries to suggest word auto-completions to users.
          - Incorporated frequency weighting to prioritize commonly typed words, enhancing user experience over time.
          - Achieved constant time predictions per keystroke, averaging under 50ms for real-time auto-completion.

      - name: CFA Tools --- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AhmedShahriar.cfa-tools) | [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Ahmed-Shahriar/cfa-tools)
        start_date: 2025-09
        end_date: "present"
        highlights:
          - Maintain my published VS Code extension providing the **only** available [C∀](https://cforall.uwaterloo.ca/) programming language tooling.
          - Develop a real-time syntax engine to improve code readability and enable future AI + IntelliSense integration.
          - Use this tool daily in CS 343 (Parallel Programming) to build concurrent programs with highlighted C∀ primitives.
